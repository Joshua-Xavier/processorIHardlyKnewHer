- program takes a file as a command line input

- program needs to read file where 1st col = name, 2nd col = arrival time (s),
and 3rd col = total processing time

- TASK1: implement first-come-first-served scheduling

- TASK2: implement round robin scheduling

- TASK3: implement shortest time remaining time scheduling

- TASK4: discuss based on results presented by each scheduling algorithm
discuss what you may observe on the overall system performance
    Which process gives a shortest waiting time
    Which process gives a shortest turnaround time on average
    which has the best system throughput


- Add testing? 

- Add catches for if a file doesnt exist or doesnt conform to the given data format

- checks for whitespace between characters
