Overall throughput of system -


Process Object
    process_id: name of process
    process_arr: process arrival time
    process_length: length of time needed to execute process

Sys Vals:

    number_of_processes = processArray.length()

    - use queue
    current_time: 0..n
    current_process: index of process array
